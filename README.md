# Etch-a-Sketch

This time, I'll be taking on a challenge to make use of my newly learnt DOM
manipulation skills. I'll be building a browser version of something between
a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.

This project was a bit challenging but with some research and resource hunting,
it was definitely doable. I had fun making this and learnt alot!
